    <h3>Bury the light</h3>
    <p>Immortal temptation<br>
    Takes over my mind, condemned<br>
    Falling weak on my knees<br>
    Summon the strength of mayhem<br>
    I am the storm that is approaching<br>
    Provoking black clouds in isolation<br>
    I am reclaimer of my name<br>
    Born in flames, I have been blessed<br>
    My family crest is a demon of death<br>
    Forsakened, I am awakened<br>
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine<br>
    Descending misery<br>
    Destiny chasing time<br>
    Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate<br>
    Can't run away<br>
    Keep walking the line, between the light<br>
    Led astray<br>
    Through vacant halls I won't surrender<br>
    The truth revealed in eyes of ember<br>
    We fight through fire and ice forever<br>
    Two souls once lost, and now they remember<br>
    I am the storm that is approaching<br>
    Provoking black clouds in isolation<br>
    I am reclaimer of my name<br>
    Born in flames, I have been blessed<br>
    My family crest is a demon of death<br>
    Forsakened, I am awakened<br>
    A phoenix's ash in dark divine<br>
    Descending misery<br>
    Destiny chasing time<br>
    Disappear into the night<br>
    Lost shadows left behind<br>
    Obsession's pulling me<br>
    Fading, I've come to take what's mine<br>
    Lurking in the shadows under veil of night<br>
    Constellations of blood pirouette<br>
    Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet<br>
    Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat<br>
    A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes<br>
    The puppet master congregates all the masses<br>
    Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit<br>
    You want this power? Then come try and take it<br>
    Beyond the tree, fire burns<br>
    Secret love, bloodline yearns<br>
    Dark minds embrace, crimson joy<br>
    Does your dim heart heal or destroy?<br>
    Bury the light deep within<br>
    Cast aside, there's no coming home<br>
    We're burning chaos in the wind<br>
    Drifting in the ocean all alone</p>
